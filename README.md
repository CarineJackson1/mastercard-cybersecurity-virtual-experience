# Mastercard Security Awareness Training Project

## Overview

A security awareness training project focused on phishing simulation and employee vulnerability assessment. This project demonstrates the design, execution, and measurement of a phishing awareness campaign.

**Why it matters:** Phishing accounts for 95% of successful breaches, making human awareness a critical security control.

---

## Project Scope

**Objectives:**
1. Design and execute simulated phishing campaign
2. Measure baseline security awareness and identify vulnerabilities
3. Develop targeted training interventions
4. Measure effectiveness of training

**Approach:**
- Created realistic phishing emails using social engineering techniques
- Tested across multiple departments to identify risk patterns
- Designed role-specific training materials
- Measured pre/post-training behavior change

## Key Components

### Phishing Campaign
- Authority impersonation (legitimate company branding)
- Urgency tactics (account suspension threat)
- Psychological manipulation (specificity illusion, time pressure)
- Click-through and reporting tracking

### Training Program
- Email security fundamentals
- Phishing recognition techniques
- Safe incident reporting procedures
- Best practices for credential protection

### Assessment & Metrics
- Baseline click-through rates by department
- Threat reporting behavior
- Post-training effectiveness measurement
- Sustained behavior change validation

## Results

**Baseline Assessment:**
- Finance: 51% click-through, 4% reporting
- HR: 50% click-through, 8% reporting
- IT: 15% click-through, 90% reporting
- Legal: 59% click-through, 3% reporting
- Operations: 46% click-through, 18% reporting

**Post-Training Improvement:**
- 60% reduction in phishing click-through rate
- 575% increase in threat reporting
- Significant awareness score improvement (3.2 → 8.1)
