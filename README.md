# Mastercard Cybersecurity Virtual Experience Program

Welcome to my completed project for Mastercard’s Cybersecurity Virtual Experience, hosted through the Forage platform.

## 🚀 Program Overview

As part of the NY CEO Jobs Council, Mastercard is dedicated to empowering youth and fostering inclusive career opportunities. Through this virtual experience, I had the opportunity to explore what it's like to work as a **Security Analyst** at Mastercard.

## 🔐 Key Project: Phishing Simulation Design

I was tasked with helping the Security Awareness team design a **phishing email simulation**. This project emphasized how social engineering is used in cyberattacks and how awareness campaigns can strengthen an organization’s security posture.

### 📨 Phishing Simulation Email (Sample)

Below is the phishing email simulation I created as part of the awareness training initiative. It is designed to mimic a realistic social engineering attack to help users recognize and report phishing attempts.

**From:** it-support@mastercard-alerts.com  
**To:** employee@email.com  
**Subject:** Security Alert: Unusual Sign-In Attempt Detected!

**Body:**

> Dear [Employee Name],  
>  
> We have detected an unusual attempt to sign in to your corporate account from an unrecognized device.  
>  
> To ensure the security of your account, we've restricted access temporarily. Please verify your identity within the next 60 minutes using the secure link below:  
>  
> [Reset Password](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phishing)  
>  
> Regards,  
> IT Security Operations Team  
> Mastercard Inc.

This simulation reinforces phishing red flags like generic greetings, urgent language, and suspicious links.

### 🎤 Awareness Training Presentation

After analyzing responses to the phishing simulation, I created a **short presentation (3–5 slides)** aimed at the **two teams that appeared most susceptible**. This internal training resource was designed to:

- Highlight the red flags from the simulation
- Explain the risks of phishing attacks
- Offer tips for identifying suspicious emails
- Provide actionable steps for reporting incidents

This follow-up effort supports Mastercard’s broader goal of improving team-specific cybersecurity awareness.

## 💡 Skills Gained

- Cybersecurity fundamentals  
- Threat recognition and mitigation  
- Phishing detection strategies  
- Designing cybersecurity training materials  
- Communication of security concepts to non-technical audiences

## 🧠 Additional Concepts Learned

As part of this simulation, I also learned the basics of using HTML for crafting phishing emails, particularly how to embed hyperlinks using anchor tags.

**Example of basic HTML hyperlink syntax:**

```html
<a href="https://example.com">Click here</a>
```
